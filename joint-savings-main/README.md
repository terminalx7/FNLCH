## Usage

### Compiling the Smart Contract
Once the joint_savings.sol script (smart contract) is loaded in the code editor, the next step is to compile it. 

First, in the Remix IDE sidebar, click the “Solidity compiler” button.

Next, in the Compiler drop-down list, select the Solidity compiler version 0.5.0. Note that the commit ID that follows the version number isn’t relevant for the purposes of this contract.

Lastley, click the “Compile message_contract.sol” button to pass the Solidity script through the compiler.

A green check mark will appear next to the “Solidity compiler” button in the sidebar signifying the program successfuly compiled.

### Deploying the Smart Contract

In the Remix IDE sidebar, navigate to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” pane, and then make sure that “JavaScript VM” is selected as the environment.

Click the Deploy button to deploy the smart contract and then confirm that it successfully deployed.
